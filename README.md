The application can be accessed on the link below:
https://opio-emmanuel-omona.github.io/Fast-food-fast/UI/



1. The flow is from Signup.html where an account is created

2. After an account has been created, then one can log in form signin.html

3. The home page is where the user can make orders and also view history

4. The admin page is where the admin handles all the orders made by users. 


Note: There's no functionality yet, therefore one can access the various pages by
      the links in the navigation bar.

      To access the admin, use the link below:
       https://opio-emmanuel-omona.github.io/Fast-food-fast/UI/admin.html

      Also most of the data is static and will be later changed
